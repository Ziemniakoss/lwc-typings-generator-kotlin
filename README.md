# LWC Typings generator

Program to generate:
- accurate schema imports
- SObject interfaces

SObject interfaces are used only to help developer to create SObjects on frontend.

# Setup

Before generating types please delete files in 
```
.sfdx/typings/lwc/sobject
```
folder.
These files are generated by vs code addon by Salesforce with read only access.

Program must be executed in top folder of SF project.

# Usage

To generate types for Account, Contact and User, call
```
java -jar jarName.jar Account Contact User
```
After successful generation interfaces can be used in code like this:
```js
class Component{
	/** @type {Account__PicklistFieldName} */
	fieldWithAutocompletionForPiclist

	/**
	 * 
	 * @param {Account[]} accounts
	 */
	printAccounts(accounts) {
		console.log(accounts)
	}
}
```

# TODO

- deeper nesting of schema (max 5, current 1)
- parallel download
-
